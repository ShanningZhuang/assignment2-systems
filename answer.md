The time not differ much from the standard python library. But in small model it is more different. I think it is because the overhead of the profile is fixed.

**Suggested Answer:**

During the forward pass only, the `ampere_sgemm_128x64_tn` kernel takes the most cumulative GPU time (43%) and is invoked 241 times per forward pass. When running both forward and backward passes together, this same kernel remains the most time-consuming at 14.0% of total time, though the backward pass introduces additional kernel variants (like `ampere_sgemm_128x32_sliced1x4_nn` at 13.5%) that distribute the workload more evenly across multiple kernel types.

---

**Explanation of what's happening:**
- In forward-only: `ampere_sgemm_128x64_tn` dominates with 43% (along with `ampere_sgemm_32x128_tn` also at 43%)
- In forward+backward: The same kernel (`ampere_sgemm_128x64_tn`) is still #1 but only 14.0% because backward pass adds many more matrix multiplications with different configurations, diluting the percentage but keeping it as the top kernel

## (c)

Although the vast majority of FLOPs take place in matrix multiplications, you will notice that
several other kernels still take a non-trivial amount of the overall runtime. What other kernels
besides matrix multiplies do you see accounting for non-trivial CUDA runtime in the forward
pass?

I need to see more context about what kernels appear in your forward pass results. Let me read your answer.md file to see what you have documented.

[1 tool called]

Based on the kernel list you've provided (which appears to be from forward+backward combined), I can see the non-matrix multiplication kernels. However, I need to check if you have separate forward-only results. Let me look at your benchmark results to see if there's more detail about forward-only kernels.

Based on what I can see in lines 82-85, here's my answer for question (c):

**Suggested Answer:**

Besides matrix multiplications, the most significant kernels in the forward pass are **elementwise operations**, including `direct_copy_kernel` (tensor copying, 3.6%), `vectorized_elementwise_kernel` with `MulFunctor` (element-wise multiplication, 2.4%), and `CUDAFunctor_add` (element-wise addition, 1.3%). These kernels are used for operations like residual connections, layer normalization, and activation functions (GELU), which involve element-wise operations that are memory-bound rather than compute-bound.

---

**Key observations:**
- Lines 82-85 show the non-GEMM kernels:
  - **3.6%**: Copy operations (likely for creating intermediate tensors)
  - **2.4%**: Element-wise multiplication (used in attention mechanism and residual connections)
  - **1.3%**: Element-wise multiplication (another variant)
  - **1.3%**: Element-wise addition (residual connections)

These percentages are from the combined forward+backward run, but these same operations would appear in the forward pass as well. If you need to verify these are specifically in the forward pass, you would need to filter the nsys results using the NVTX ranges as the question suggests.

## (d)

The fraction of time spent of matrix multiplication decreased. The cuda add function kernel portion increased.

## (e)

Compare the runtime of the softmax operation versus the matrix multiplication operations within
the self-attention layer of your model during a forward pass. How does the difference in runtimes
compare to the difference in FLOPs?

**Observed Runtimes (from NVTX profiling):**
- Attention scores matmul (Q @ K^T): 526 μs
- Softmax operation: 288 μs
- Final matmul (attention @ V): 295 μs

**Analysis:**

The softmax operation takes approximately 288 μs, while the matrix multiplications take 526 μs and 295 μs respectively. The softmax runtime is roughly 55% of the attention scores matmul and similar to the final matmul.

However, in terms of FLOPs, the difference is much more dramatic. For a self-attention layer with sequence length S, hidden dimension d, and number of heads h:
- Each matmul (Q@K^T and attention@V) requires O(S² × d) FLOPs
- Softmax requires only O(S² × h) FLOPs (exponentials, sums, and divisions)

Since d >> h (typically d = 768 and h = 12 for the small model), the matrix multiplications have roughly 64× more FLOPs than softmax. Yet softmax takes only about 2× less time than the matmuls.

**Conclusion:** Softmax is significantly less efficient in terms of FLOPs/second compared to matrix multiplication. This is because:
1. **Matrix multiplications are compute-bound** and achieve high GPU utilization through optimized GEMM kernels
2. **Softmax is memory-bound** - it requires reading/writing data for exponentials and normalization, with relatively few arithmetic operations per memory access
3. The GPU's tensor cores can accelerate matrix multiplications but not element-wise operations like softmax

This demonstrates that runtime is not proportional to FLOPs - memory bandwidth and kernel optimization matter significantly.

   FP16 Result: 4.0, Error: 6.0
   BF16 Result: 0.5, Error: 9.5

============================================================
OBSERVATIONS:
============================================================

The results demonstrate the importance of accumulation precision:

1. Float32 accumulation maintains high accuracy with minimal error.

2. Float16 accumulation suffers from significant precision loss due to limited
   mantissa bits (10 bits) and rounding errors that compound over iterations.

3. BFloat16 accumulation also suffers from precision loss, though for different
   reasons than FP16:
   - BF16 has even fewer mantissa bits (7 bits) than FP16 (10 bits)
   - However, BF16 has the same exponent range as FP32 (8 bits)
   - This means BF16 can represent the same range of values as FP32, but with
     less precision (more rounding per operation)
   - For accumulation, the reduced mantissa precision still causes errors to
     compound, though differently than FP16

4. Mixed precision (float32 accumulator with float16/bfloat16 values) preserves
   accuracy by performing the accumulation in higher precision, regardless of
   whether the conversion is implicit or explicit.

5. In the larger accumulation test (10000 iterations), the errors become more
   pronounced, clearly showing:
   - FP32: minimal error (< 1e-6)
   - FP16: moderate error due to both limited mantissa and accumulation
   - BF16: error in between FP16 and FP32, demonstrating that while BF16 has
     better range than FP16, it still suffers from accumulation issues due to
     limited mantissa precision

Conclusion: For accumulation-heavy operations (like computing mean/variance in
LayerNorm), using FP32 is important even when using BF16 or FP16 elsewhere.

# benchmarking_mixed_precision

## (a)

Consider the following model:
class ToyModel(nn.Module):
2 def __init__(self, in_features: int, out_features: int):
3 super().__init__()
4 self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_features, 10, bias=False)
5 self.ln = nn.LayerNorm(10)
6 self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, out_features, bias=False)
7 self.relu = nn.ReLU()
8
9 def forward(self, x):
10 x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
11 x = self.ln(x)
12 x = self.fc2(x)
13 return x
Suppose we are training the model on a GPU and that the model parameters are originally in
FP32. We'd like to use autocasting mixed precision with FP16. What are the data types of:
• the model parameters within the autocast context,
• the output of the first feed-forward layer (ToyModel.fc1),
• the output of layer norm (ToyModel.ln),
• the model's predicted logits,
• the loss,
• and the model's gradients?
Deliverable: The data types for each of the components listed above.

**Answer:**

- **Model parameters within the autocast context**: FP32
  - Autocast does not change the stored parameter dtypes; parameters remain in their original FP32 format. Autocast only affects the computation dtypes during forward pass operations.

- **Output of the first feed-forward layer (ToyModel.fc1)**: FP16
  - Linear layers (matrix multiplications) are autocasted to FP16 for performance. The computation is done in FP16 and the output is FP16.

- **Output of layer norm (ToyModel.ln)**: FP32
  - LayerNorm is kept in FP32 for numerical stability. Normalization operations involve computing means and variances which can suffer from precision issues in FP16.

- **Model's predicted logits**: FP16
  - The final linear layer (fc2) is autocasted to FP16, so the output logits are in FP16.

- **Loss**: FP32
  - Loss computation (e.g., cross-entropy) is typically performed in FP32 for numerical stability, especially since it involves operations like log and exp that can be sensitive to precision.

- **Model's gradients**: FP32
  - Gradients are stored in the same dtype as the parameters (FP32). During backward pass, gradients may be computed in mixed precision, but they are accumulated and stored in FP32 to maintain training stability and prevent underflow/overflow issues.

**How Autocast Identifies Which Operations to Downcast:**

PyTorch's autocast maintains three lists of operations:

1. **FP16-eligible operations (downcasted to FP16)**: Operations that benefit from FP16 speedup and are numerically stable in lower precision. These include:
   - Matrix multiplications (nn.Linear, torch.matmul, torch.bmm)
   - Convolutions (nn.Conv2d, etc.)
   - These are compute-intensive operations where FP16 provides significant performance gains via tensor cores

2. **FP32-required operations (kept in FP32)**: Operations that require higher precision for numerical stability:
   - Normalization layers (LayerNorm, BatchNorm)
   - Loss functions (cross-entropy, softmax)
   - Reductions (sum, mean) that accumulate values
   - Operations involving exponentials and logarithms

3. **Promotion operations**: Operations that can handle mixed inputs and will promote to the widest dtype:
   - Element-wise operations (add, multiply)
   - Activation functions (ReLU, GELU)

Autocast automatically casts inputs to the appropriate dtype based on which list the operation belongs to, ensuring both performance and numerical stability.

## (b)

You should have seen that FP16 mixed precision autocasting treats the layer normalization layer
differently than the feed-forward layers. What parts of layer normalization are sensitive to mixed
precision? If we use BF16 instead of FP16, do we still need to treat layer normalization differently?
Why or why not?

Answer:

### 1. Layer Normalization Equation and Python Code

**Equation:**

For standard LayerNorm, given input x of shape (batch, features):

```
mean = (1/d) Σ x_i
variance = (1/d) Σ (x_i - mean)²
normalized = (x - mean) / sqrt(variance + ε)
output = γ * normalized + β
```

For RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Normalization), which is used in the codebase:

```
RMS = sqrt((1/d) Σ x_i² + ε)
normalized = x / RMS
output = γ * normalized
```

**Python Code (RMSNorm from the codebase):**

```python
class RMSNorm(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size: int, eps: float = 1e-5, device=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(hidden_size, device=device))
        self.eps = eps

    def forward(self, x):
        # NOTE: in practice, many implementations will
        # manually upcast the input to fp32 here to prevent overflow when you
        # square the input.
        in_dtype = x.dtype
        
        x = x.to(torch.float32)
        rms = torch.rsqrt(x.pow(2).mean(-1, keepdim=True) + self.eps)
        x = x * rms
        
        return (self.weight * x).to(in_dtype)
```

### 2. Parts of Layer Normalization Sensitive to Mixed Precision

Layer normalization has several operations that are sensitive to FP16 precision:

**a) Squaring operation (x²):**
- When values in x are large (close to FP16 max of 65,504), squaring can cause **overflow**
- FP16 has limited dynamic range: max value is 65,504, so values above ~255 will overflow when squared
- This is why the code explicitly upcasts to FP32 before `x.pow(2)`

**b) Mean/Variance accumulation:**
- Computing the mean requires summing many values: `Σ x_i²` or `Σ (x_i - mean)²`
- This is an **accumulation operation** that is highly sensitive to precision loss
- As demonstrated in the `mix_precision_accumulation.py` experiment, FP16 accumulation suffers from:
  - Limited mantissa precision (10 bits vs 23 bits in FP32)
  - Rounding errors that compound over iterations
  - When summing many small values, precision loss accumulates significantly

**c) Division and reciprocal square root:**
- Computing `1/sqrt(variance + ε)` involves a reciprocal square root operation
- Small errors in the variance calculation can be amplified by the division
- When variance is small, numerical instability increases

**d) Small epsilon value:**
- The epsilon term (typically 1e-5) is added for numerical stability
- In FP16, the smallest normal number is ~6e-5, making 1e-5 difficult to represent accurately
- This can cause issues when variance is very small

### 3. BF16 vs FP16 for Layer Normalization

**Do we still need to treat layer normalization differently with BF16?**

**Short answer: It depends on the specific operations, but generally BF16 is safer and may not require special treatment in many cases.**

**Why BF16 is different from FP16:**

| Property | FP32 | FP16 | BF16 |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Exponent bits | 8 | 5 | 8 |
| Mantissa bits | 23 | 10 | 7 |
| Dynamic range | ~10^±38 | ~10^±4.8 | ~10^±38 |
| Max value | ~3.4e38 | 65,504 | ~3.4e38 |
| Precision | High | Medium | Lower |

**Analysis:**

1. **Overflow issues (SOLVED with BF16):**
   - BF16 has the **same exponent range as FP32** (8 bits)
   - The squaring operation `x²` is much less likely to overflow in BF16
   - No need to upcast specifically to prevent overflow

2. **Accumulation precision (STILL PROBLEMATIC with BF16):**
   - BF16 has **fewer mantissa bits** (7 vs 23 in FP32)
   - Accumulation operations like `Σ x_i²` still suffer from rounding errors
   - While less severe than FP16, precision loss still compounds over many additions
   - For large hidden dimensions (e.g., 4096), summing many values will accumulate errors

3. **Small epsilon representation (BETTER with BF16):**
   - BF16 can represent much smaller values than FP16 (similar range to FP32)
   - Epsilon values like 1e-5 are representable in BF16
   - Less concern about epsilon being rounded to zero

**Conclusion:**

With BF16, we **may not need to treat layer normalization as strictly** as with FP16, particularly regarding overflow. However:

- **Still recommended to use FP32 for accumulation operations** (mean, variance) to maintain training stability and numerical accuracy
- **Overflow is no longer a major concern** with BF16, so the explicit upcast for squaring is less critical
- **In practice**, many implementations still keep LayerNorm in FP32 even with BF16 for maximum numerical stability, though it's less critical than with FP16
- The trade-off is performance vs. numerical stability - for most applications, keeping LayerNorm in FP32 is a safe choice regardless of whether using FP16 or BF16 for the rest of the model

With the increasing of the model or context. The time is smaller. I guess it is because the autocast to the BF16 costs a fixed time.
The kernel has also been replaced with BF16.

# memory_profiling

(a)

In forward only mode, the memory cost is almost the same regardless of the context length.
In training and the backward only, the memory cost significantly increasing with the context length because it need to store the activation and the gradient.

(b)

Peak of the forward-only is about 14GB
Peak of the backward-only in 128 is about 26GB, 256 about 26GB, 512 about 40GB.
Peak of the training-only in 128 is about 55GB, 256 about 55GB, 512 about 70GB

(c)

In the forward the bf16 is even more than fp32 because we need a copy of the original parameters.

Peak in bf16 is about 20GB.

In the training-only the memory cost of the bf16 is almost the same as the fp32.

(d)

Let me calculate the total memory cost for all activations, considering what needs to be stored during forward pass and training.

[1 tool called]

Now let me calculate the total memory requirements systematically for all activations.

## Memory Calculation for 2.7B Model

**Model configuration:**
- `d_model` = 2560
- `d_ff` = 10240 
- `num_layers` = 32
- `num_heads` = 32
- Parameters: 3,406,809,600 (~3.4B)

**Variables:**
- `B` = batch size
- `S` = sequence length

---

## Part 1: Forward Pass Memory (Activations Saved for Backward)

For each transformer layer, PyTorch must save certain activations for gradient computation during backward pass.

### Per Layer - Attention Block:

1. **Input to attention** (for residual gradient): `(B, S, d_model)`
2. **Q, K, V projections**: `3 × (B, S, d_model)`
3. **Attention scores** (Q @ K^T before softmax): `(B, num_heads, S, S)`
4. **Attention weights** (after softmax): `(B, num_heads, S, S)`
5. **Attention output** (before output projection): `(B, num_heads, S, d_head)`

**Elements per layer (Attention):**
```
= B×S×d_model + 3×B×S×d_model + 2×B×num_heads×S² + B×S×d_model
= 5×B×S×2560 + 2×B×32×S²
= 12,800×B×S + 64×B×S²
```

### Per Layer - SwiGLU FFN Block:

1. **Input to FFN** (for residual gradient): `(B, S, d_model)`
2. **w1(x) output** (before SiLU): `(B, S, d_ff)`
3. **w3(x) output**: `(B, S, d_ff)`
4. **After SiLU and multiply**: `(B, S, d_ff)`
5. **Final output**: `(B, S, d_model)`

**Elements per layer (FFN):**
```
= B×S×d_model + 3×B×S×d_ff + B×S×d_model
= 2×B×S×2560 + 3×B×S×10240
= 5,120×B×S + 30,720×B×S
= 35,840×B×S
```

### Total Per Layer:
```
Attention + FFN = (12,800 + 35,840)×B×S + 64×B×S²
                = 48,640×B×S + 64×B×S²
```

### Total for 32 Layers:
```
Elements = 32 × (48,640×B×S + 64×B×S²)
         = 1,556,480×B×S + 2,048×B×S²
         = B×S×(1,556,480 + 2,048×S)
```

### Forward Pass Activation Memory (FP32, 4 bytes per element):

```
Bytes = 4 × B×S×(1,556,480 + 2,048×S)
      = B×S×(6,225,920 + 8,192×S) bytes
```

**In MB:**
```
= B×S×(6,225,920 + 8,192×S) / 1,048,576
= B×S×(5.9375 + 0.0078125×S) MB
```

### Verification with B=4, S=512:
```
= 4 × 512 × (5.9375 + 0.0078125×512)
= 2,048 × (5.9375 + 4)
= 2,048 × 9.9375
= 20,352 MB ≈ 20 GB
```

---

## Part 2: Complete Training Step with AdamW

For a complete training step, we need:

### 1. **Model Parameters** (FP32):
```
Parameters = 3,406,809,600
Bytes = 3,406,809,600 × 4 = 13,627,238,400 bytes
≈ 13.0 GB
```

### 2. **Gradients** (FP32, same size as parameters):
```
≈ 13.0 GB
```

### 3. **AdamW Optimizer States**:
- **First moment (m)**: Same size as parameters ≈ 13.0 GB
- **Second moment (v)**: Same size as parameters ≈ 13.0 GB
```
Total optimizer states = 26.0 GB
```

### 4. **Activations** (from forward pass):
```
= B×S×(5.9375 + 0.0078125×S) MB
```

### **Total Training Memory:**

```
Total = 52.0 GB + B×S×(5.9375 + 0.0078125×S) MB
```

Or more precisely in MB:
```
Total = 53,248 + B×S×(5.9375 + 0.0078125×S) MB
```

---

## Summary Formulas

### Forward Pass Only (FP32):
```
Memory (MB) = B × S × (5.9375 + 0.0078125×S)
Memory (GB) = B × S × (0.0058 + 0.0000076×S)
```

### Training Step with AdamW (FP32):
```
Memory (MB) = 53,248 + B × S × (5.9375 + 0.0078125×S)
Memory (GB) = 52.0 + B × S × (0.0058 + 0.0000076×S)
```

## Concrete Examples

| B | S | Forward Pass | Training Step | Notes |
|---|---|--------------|---------------|-------|
| 4 | 128 | **3.8 GB** | **55.8 GB** | Matches answer.md: ~55GB |
| 4 | 256 | **7.1 GB** | **59.1 GB** | |
| 4 | 512 | **20.4 GB** | **72.4 GB** | Matches answer.md: ~70GB |
| 4 | 1024 | **73.7 GB** | **125.7 GB** | OOM on most GPUs |

---

## Key Observations

1. **Quadratic growth**: The `64×B×S²` term (from attention scores) dominates at large S
   - At S=128: Linear term dominates
   - At S=512: Quadratic term becomes significant  
   - At S=1024: Quadratic term dominates (4× the memory of S=512)

2. **Training overhead**: Fixed ~52 GB for parameters + gradients + optimizer states

3. **Memory bottleneck**: The attention score matrices `(B, H, S, S)` across 32 layers consume `2,048×B×S²` elements, which is:
   - S=512: 512 MB per batch element
   - S=1024: 2 GB per batch element

4. **Why your benchmarks ran out of memory**: At S=1024 with B=4:
   - Training needs ~126 GB
   - Your GPU likely has 40-80 GB
   - This explains why "xl 1024 and 2.7B 1024 ran out of memory"

(e)

The largest is multiple 100MB and add up to about 10GB and I think it is the parameter of the model.

# pytorch_attention

The benchmark is in the ./benchmarks/benchmark_attention.py.
The attention implementation is in the attention.py.
